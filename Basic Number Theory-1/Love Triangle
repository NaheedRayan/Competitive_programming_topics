Two boys, Venky and Sagar, are at war over a girl, Riu. Driven by their feelings, 
they decided to confess to Riu. Since both of them were equally dumb, Riu decided that
she would go out with that boy who would successfully find the pattern and thus prove that he is less dumb.

hint:Converting base form 10 to 9
How would you convert decimal to base 9?

For the integer part:

Divide through 9 until the quotient is zero. Than read the reminders in reverse order.

For example 125 43910=211 0569

Calculation:

125439:9=13937	r=6
13937 :9=1548	r=5
1548  :9=172	r=0
172   :9=19		r=1
19    :9=2		r=1
2     :9=0		r=2
For the part after decimal just multiply with 9 until you get a whole number or a period starts to emerge (this will always be the case as 9 and 10 are co-prime) and take the digit you get before the decimal point as result (this time in order).

for example 0.410=35¯¯¯¯¯9

Calculation:

0.4*9=3.6
0.6*9=5.4
0.4*9=3.6 <-- and we can stop here as you can see we get into a loop
an other way would be transfer the decimal to a fraction, convert both the numerator and the denominator to base 9 and try base 9 division here:

0.4=25

Ok remember when dividing that it is base 9:

2:5=0.35
20_9=18
16_9=15
 30_9=27
 27_9=25

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

long long base9(long long n)
{
    if (n < 9)
        return n;
    else
    {
        return (n % 9 + 10 * base9(n / 9));
    }
}

int main()
{
    string str;
    long long n;
    while (cin >> n)
    {
        
        cout << base9(n) << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
