Before the outbreak of corona virus to the world, a meeting
happened in a room in Wuhan. A person who attended that meeting had 
COVID-19 and no one in the room knew about it! So everyone started 
shaking hands with everyone else in the room as a gesture of respect
and after meeting unfortunately every one got infected! Given the 
fact that any two persons shake hand exactly once, Can you tell the
total count of handshakes happened in that meeting?

Say no to shakehands. Regularly wash your hands. Stay Safe.

Input Format 
The first line contains the number of test cases T, T lines follow. 
Each line then contains an integer N, the total number of people 
attended that meeting.

Output Format

Print the number of handshakes for each test-case in a new line.

Constraints 

1 <= T <= 1000 
0 < N < 106   

Please fill this form(ignore if already filled)

SAMPLE OUTPUT

Explaination:
Lets say there are n = 20  people in a room . Now if the do hand shake then each people will do 19 hand shakes.
That is 20 * 19 = 380 handshakes .
But there were 2 people involved .So 380/2 = 190 ans.
So the formula is n(n-1)/2 

It can be solved using nCr formula also . 20C2 would be the answer in that case .


Solution:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;


int handshake(int n) 
{
    return n*(n-1)/2;
}

int main()
{

    int t;
    cin >> t;
 

    while(t--)
    {
            int n;
            cin >> n;

            int result = handshake(n);
    
            cout << result << "\n";
        }
    return 0;
}
